## Objectives

The learning objectives for this challenge assignment are as follows:

- To configure Git and GitHub on your laptop and on the GitHub servers
- To transfer files from your laptop to your GitHub repository
- To use a Docker container to run the automated checks performed by GatorGrader
- To install the programs that you need to support the creation of a Python program
- To use a terminal window to run a Python program and observe its output
- To use your text editor and a terminal window to implement a Python program
- To perform file input and output with a Python program
- To count and display the lines in different types of text files

## Introduction

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader/), this repository
contains a challenge assignment for an introductory computer science class
that uses the Python programming language. The source code and technical
writing for this assignment must pass tests set by the [GatorGrader
tool](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader). When you use the `git
commit` and `git push` commands to transfer your source code to your GitHub
repository, GitHub Actions will initialize a build of your assignment, checking
to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both your source code and
writing meet all of the established requirements, then you will see a green ✔
in the listing of commits in GitHub. If your submission does not meet the
requirements, a red ❌ will appear instead. Please note that, at the option of
the course instructor, some checks may be run in GitHub Actions that are not
run locally by the [GatorGrader
tool](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).

## Continuous Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the
following GitHub guides: [Mastering
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello
World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these
guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and
[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

Students who want to learn more about how to use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) should review the [Docker
Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/). Students are also encouraged to review
the documentation for their text editor, which is available in the [VS Code
docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs). You should also review the [Git
documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) to learn more about how to use the Git
command-line client. In addition to talking with the instructor and technical
leader for your course, students are encouraged to search
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for answers to their technical
questions.

As outlined in the course schedule in the [course planning
repository](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/cs102-F2020-plans),
students should also read all of the assigned readings for up to and including
the week of the semester on which this challenge assignment was assigned.

## Assignment Reminders

- **Follow each step carefully**. Slowly read each sentence in this document,
  making sure that you precisely follow each instruction. Take notes about each
  step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas and the challenges
  that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a technical leader or the
  course instructor what assignment step you recently completed.

- **Regularly ask and answer questions**. Please log into Slack at the start of
  the challenge session and then join the appropriate channel. If you have a
  question about one of the steps in an assignment, then you can post it to the
  designated channel, discussing your questions through both Slack and the
  Google Meet designated for the class.

- **Store your files in GitHub**. Starting with this challenge assignment, you
  will be responsible for storing all of your files (e.g., Python source code
  and Markdown-based writing) in a Git repository using GitHub Classroom. Please
  verify that you have saved your source code in your Git repository by using
  `git status` to ensure that everything is updated. You can see if your
  assignment submission meets the established correctness requirements by using
  the provided checking tools on your local computer and by checking the commits
  in GitHub.

- **Keep all of your files**. Don't delete your programs, output files, and
  written reports after you submit them through GitHub; you will need them
  again when you study for the course assessments and work on the other
  challenge, practical, and technical challenge assignments.

- **Hone your technical writing skills**. Computer science assignments require
  to you write technical documentation and descriptions of your experiences when
  completing each task. Take extra care to ensure that your writing is
  interesting and both grammatically and technically correct, remembering that
  computer scientists must effectively communicate and collaborate with their
  team members and the student technical leaders and course instructor.

- **Review the Honor Code on the syllabus**. While you may discuss your
  assignments with others, copying source code or technical writing is a
  violation of Allegheny College's Honor Code.

## Accessing the Assignment

To access this assignment, you should go into the `#announcements` channel in
our Slack workspace and find the announcement that provides a link for it. Copy
this link and paste it into your web browser. Now, you should accept the
challenge assignment and see that GitHub Classroom created a new GitHub
repository for you to access the assignment's starting materials and to store
the completed version of your assignment. Specifically, to access your new
GitHub repository for this assignment, please click the green "Accept" button
and then click the link that is prefaced with the label "Your assignment has
been created here". If you accepted the assignment and correctly followed these
steps, you should have created a GitHub repository with a name like
`Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-Fall-2020/computer-science-102-fall-2020-challenge-3-gkapfham`.
Unless you provide the course instructor with documentation of the extenuating
circumstances that you are facing, not accepting the assignment means that you
automatically receive a failing grade for all of its components.

Before you move to the next step of this challenge assignment, please make
sure that you read all of the content on the web site for your new GitHub
repository, paying close attention to the technical details about the commands
that you will type and the output that your program must produce. Now you are
ready to download the starting materials to your challenge computer. Click the
"Clone or download" button and, after ensuring that you have selected "Clone
with SSH", please copy this command to your clipboard. To enter into your
course directory directory you should now type `cd cs102F2020`. Next, you can
type the either `ls` (on either MacOS or Linux) or `dir` (on Windows 10 Pro or
Windows 10 Enterprise) and see that there are no files or directories inside of
this directory. By typing `git clone` in your terminal and then pasting in the
string that you copied from the GitHub site you will "download" all of the code
for this assignment. For instance, if the course instructor ran the `git clone`
  command in the terminal, it would look like:

```
git clone git@github.com:Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/computer-science-102-fall-2020-challenge-3-gkapfham.git
```

After this command finishes, you can use `cd` to change into the new directory.
If you want to "go back" one directory from your current location, then you can
type the command `cd ..`. Finally, please continue to use the `cd` and `ls`
commands to explore the files that you automatically downloaded from GitHub. If
one of the aforementioned commands does not work correctly, then it is possible
that your terminal window is not up-to-date or not configured correctly. In this
case, please share your specific error messages with the instructor, ultimately
working to master the use of terminal commands. What files and directories do
you see? What do you think is their purpose? Spend some time exploring, telling
your discoveries to a student technical leader.

## Challenge Assignment Tasks

### Implementing a Python Program that Can Count Lines in an Input File

For this technical challenge you are invited to implement a Python program that
can count the number of lines in the text file specified on the command line. As
you study the provided source code, you should notice that there are `TODO`
markers indicating that you need to add some source code statements before the
program will work correctly. For instance, here is the output from respectively
running the commands `poetry run python linecounter --data-file
inputs/career-data.txt` and `poetry run python linecounter --data-file
inputs/computer-data.txt`.

```
Welcome to the line counter program!

The data file inputs/career-data.txt contains 50000 lines of data in it!
```

```
Welcome to the line counter program!

The data file inputs/computer-data.txt contains 200 lines of data in it!
```

For this program you are invited to implement it in any suitable fashion as long
as your program's source code adheres to all industry-standard best practices.
To determine if your program adheres to certain basic standards, you should run
the command `poetry run pylint linecounter`, fixing any issues that it raises.
It is also a good idea for your to run the command `poetry run flake8
linecounter` to ensure that your program and test suite adheres to the
guidelines enforced by the industry-standard `flake8` linting tool. Finally, you
can ensure that your program's source code has an industry-standard format by
running the command `poetry run black linecounter`. Students who would like to
do so are also invited to add a test suite to their program!

### Reflecting on the Challenge Assignment

Once you have finished both of the previous technical tasks, use your text
editor to answer all of the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` file. For
instance, you should provide the output of the Python program in a fenced code
block, making sure that you show how the program's output differs depending on
the input file that you specify on the command line.

### Transferring Your Source Code and Technical Writing to GitHub

As you are working on your challenge assignment, please make sure that you use
VSCode or your terminal window to regularly save your work and transfer it to
the GitHub servers. For instance, please use the `git commit` command in your
terminal window or use the similar feature in VSCode to "stage" your changes in
your repository. Once you have committed your source code to your repository,
you can use the `git push` command to transfer your work to your GitHub
repository, making it available for the course instructor to assess. Please make
sure that you regularly commit your source code and technical writing, using
descriptive commit messages to explain how each commit changes the contents of
the repository. Please do not use vacuous commit messages that do not explain
how your commit changes the contents of the repository!

## Automated Checks with GatorGrader

In addition to meeting all of the requirements outlined in this assignment
sheet, your submission must pass the following checks that
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) automatically
assesses:

If [GatorGrader's](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) automated
checks pass correctly, the tool will produce the output like the following in
addition to returning a zero exit code (which you can access by typing the
command `echo $?`). You will need to run
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) in a Docker
container by following the steps in the [Using Docker](#using-docker) section.

- The reflection.md in writing has exactly 2 of the `heading` tag
- The reflection.md in writing has exactly 0 of the `TODO` fragment
- The \_\_main\_\_.py in linecounter/linecounter has at least 2 multiple-line Python comment(s)
- The reflection.md in writing has at least 4 of the `code_block` tag
- The \_\_main\_\_.py in linecounter/linecounter has at least 4 single-line Python comment(s)
- The reflection.md in writing has exactly 0 of the `Add Your Name Here` fragment
- The \_\_main\_\_.py in linecounter/linecounter has exactly 0 of the `TODO` fragment
- The repository has at least 5 commit(s)!
- The file \_\_main\_\_.py exists in the linecounter/linecounter directory
- The file reflection.md exists in the writing directory
- The reflection.md in writing has at least 4 of the `code` tag
- The command `cd linecounter; poetry install;poetry run python linecounter --data-file inputs/career-data.txt; cd ..` executes correctly

## Assignment Assessment

Again taking inspiration from the principles of [specification-based
grading](https://www.amazon.com/Specifications-Grading-Restoring-Motivating-Students/dp/1620362422),
the grade that a student receives on either a challenge assignment or a
technical challenge will be based on whether or not it meets the standards for
technical work in the fields of software engineering and discrete structures as
evidenced by:

- **GitHub Actions Build Status of Either ✔  or ❌**: Your work will receive a ✔
  if the last before-the-deadline build in GitHub Actions passes and a ✔ appears
  in the GitHub commit log instead of an ❌. The build status reported by
  GitHub Actions will only be a ✔ if the Python source code and technical
  writing in the GitHub repository pass all of both the GatorGrader checks and
  any additional checks.

## Advance Feedback on an Assignment

Students who wish to receive feedback on their work for any course assignment
should first open an issue on the issue tracker for their assignment's GitHub
repository, giving an appropriate title and description for the type of feedback
that you would like the course instructor to provide. After creating this issue,
you will see that GitHub has created a unique web site that references it. To
alert the course instructor to the fact that the issue was created and that you
want feedback on your work, please send it to him by a Slack direct message at
least 24 hours in advance of the project's due date. After the instructor
responds to the issue, please resolve all of the stated concerns and participate
in the discussion until the issue is resolved and ultimately marked as closed.

## Discussion of a Graded Assignment

Students who wish to receive feedback on their work for any graded course
assignment should leave question in the same region of Github where the course
instructor submitted the assignment's grade. For example, if the instructor
submits your grade to a pull request in your repository for a challenge
assignment, then you should ask questions about your grade in that pull request,
bearing in mind the need to @-mention the course instructor in the body of your
comment. Students can continue to discuss the graded assignment with the course
instructor until they understand all the technical topics that were the
focus of the particular assignment.

## Additional System Resources

### System Commands

This project invites students to enter system commands into a terminal window.
This assignment uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to deliver programs, such
as `gradle` and the source code and packages needed to run
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader), to a students'
computer, thereby eliminating the need for a programmer to install them on their
development workstation. Individuals who do not want to install Docker can
optionally install of the programs mentioned in the [Project
Requirements](#requirements) section of this document.

### Non-Interactive Docker Commands

Once you have installed [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), with MacOS and Linux
you can use the following `docker run` command to start `gradle grade` as a
containerized application, using the
[DockaGator](https://github.com/GatorEducator/dockagator) Docker image available
on
[DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/gatoreducator/repository/docker/gatoreducator/dockagator).

```bash
docker run --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd)":/project \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator":/root/.local/share \
  gatoreducator/dockagator
```

The aforementioned command will use `"$(pwd)"` (i.e., the current working
directory) as the project directory and `"$HOME/.dockagator"` as the cached
GatorGrader directory. Please note that both of these directories must exist,
although only the project directory must contain something. Generally, the
project directory should contain the source code and technical writing for an
assignment, as provided to a student by the instructor through GitHub.
Additionally, the cached directory should not contain anything other than
directories and programs created by DockaGator, thus ensuring that they are not
otherwise overwritten during the completion of the assignment.

To ensure that the previous command will work correctly, you should create the
cache directory by running the command `mkdir $HOME/.dockagator` on the MacOS
and Linux operating systems. However, if you are using the Windows operating
system then you will instead need to type the command `mkdir
%HomeDrive%%HomePath%/.dockagator`. Finally, since the above `docker run`
command does not work correctly on the Windows operating system, you will need
to instead run the following command to adapt to the differences in the `cmd`
terminal window:

```bash
docker run --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "%cd%:/project" \
  -v "%HomeDrive%%HomePath%/.dockagator:/root/.local/share" \
  gatoreducator/dockagator
```

Please note that not all version of the Windows terminal window will correctly
recognize the use of the `%cd%` and `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` variables. In this
case, you should substitute the actual directory for a specific course
assignment for the `%cd%` variable and the drive letter that contains the
`.dockagator` directory for the `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` variable. Finally, the
Windows terminal window may not work correctly when you attempt to run a
multi-line command. In this case, you should break up the aforementioned
four-line command into separate lines, like `docker run --rm --name dockagator`
and `-v "%cd%:/project"` and then connect them into a single long line that you
separate by a single space. Here is an example of what the long command would
look like, again assuming that the Windows `cmd` terminal correctly interprets
the `%cd%` and `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` variables:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name dockagator -v "%cd%:/project" -v "%HomeDrive%%HomePath%/.dockagator:/root/.local/share" gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash
```

Here are some additional commands that you may need to run when using Docker:

* `docker info`: display information about how Docker runs on your workstation
* `docker images`: show the Docker images installed on your workstation
* `docker container list`: list the active images running on your workstation
* `docker system prune`: remove many types of "dangling" components from your workstation
* `docker image prune`: remove all "dangling" docker images from your workstation
* `docker container prune`: remove all stopped docker containers from your workstation
* `docker rmi $(docker images -q) --force`: remove all docker images from your workstation

### Commands for an Interactive Docker Shell

Since the above `docker run` command uses a Docker images that, by default, runs
`gradle grade` and then exits the Docker container, you may want to instead run
the following command so that you enter an "interactive terminal" that will
allow you to repeatedly run commands within the Docker container. Don't forget
that, if you are using the Windows operating system, then you will need to use a
different command to run Docker, as explained previously in this document.
Importantly, the command that you type if you are a Windows user should still
contain the `-it` at the start of the `docker run` and the `/bin/bash` at the
end of the command. However, the other components of this command need to be
customized for the Windows operating system.

If you use either MacOS or Linux, then this is the command that you would run to
enter into the interactive terminal provided by a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd)":/project \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator":/root/.local/share \
  gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash
```

If you use Windows, then this is the command that you would run to enter into
the interactive terminal provided by a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -t --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "%cd%:/project" \
  -v "%HomeDrive%%HomePath%/.dockagator:/root/.local/share" \
  gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash
```

Once you have typed this command, you can use the [GatorGrader
tool](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) in the Docker container by
typing the command `gradle grade` in your terminal. Running this command will
produce a lot of output that you should carefully inspect. If GatorGrader's
output shows that there are no mistakes in a course assignment, then your source
code and technical writing are passing all of the automated baseline checks.
However, if the output indicates that there are mistakes, then you will need to
understand what they are and then try to fix them.

Remember, to correctly run any of the commands mentioned in this guide, you must
be in the main (i.e., "home base") directory for a course assignment where the
`build.gradle` file is located.

### Upgrading the Docker Container

If the course instructor provides a new version of the Docker container called
`gatoreducator/dockagator` and you want to receive it immediately, you must
first delete the existing Docker container on your laptop by running the command
`docker rmi gatoreducator/dockagator`. Next, you can re-run one of the
aforementioned Docker commands, like the following one, which would work on
MacOS or Linux:

```
docker run -it --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd)":/project \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator":/root/.local/share \
  gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash
```

Please note that if you attempt to run `gradle grade` in an updated Docker
container it is possible that the command will execute incorrectly if you
previously used GatorGrader with a Docker container that featured a different
version of the Python programming language. In this situation, you should delete
the directories inside of the `.dockagator` directory and then again attempt to
run the `gradle grade` command inside of the Docker container. Specifically, you
will need to delete directories in `.dockagator` that are normally called
`gatorgrader`, `virtualenv`, and `virtualenvs`.

### Downloading Project Updates

If GatorGrader's maintainers push updates to this sample assignment and you
received it through GitHub Classroom and you would like to also receive these
updates, then you can type this command in the main directory for this
assignment:

```
git remote add download git@github.com:Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/cs102-F2020-challenge3-starter.git
```

You should only need to type this command once; running the command additional
times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of
your Git repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the
GatorGrader maintainers by typing this command:

```
git pull download master
```

This second command can be run whenever the maintainers needs to provide you
with new source code for this assignment. However, please note that, if you have
edited the files that we updated, running the previous command may lead to Git
merge conflicts. If this happens, you may need to manually resolve them with the
help of the instructor or a student technical leader. Finally, please note that
the [Gradle plugin](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgradle) for
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) will automatically
download the newest version of GatorGrader.

### Using GitHub Actions

This assignment uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to
automatically run [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader)
and additional checking programs every time you commit to your GitHub
repository. The checking will start as soon as you have accepted the assignment
&mdash; thus creating your own private repository &mdash; and the course
instructor and/or GitHub enables GitHub Actions on it. If you do not see either
a yellow &#9679; or a green ✔ or a red ❌ in your listing of commits, then
please ask the instructor to see whether or not GitHub Actions was correctly
enabled.

### System Requirements

This assignment was developed to work with the following software and versions:

- Docker Desktop
- Operating Systems
  - Linux
  - MacOS
  - Windows 10 Pro
  - Windows 10 Enterprise
- Programming Language Tools
  - Gradle 6.6
  - MDL 0.5.0
  - Python 3.7 or 3.8
